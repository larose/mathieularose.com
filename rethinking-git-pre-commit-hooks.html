    <h1>Rethinking Git Pre-Commit Hooks</h1>
    <p>December 2025</p>
  </hgroup>

  <p>I've worked on many projects where, as part of the development setup, tools like <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky">Husky</a> are used to automatically inject git pre-commit hooks. Once installed, these hooks run locally on the developer's machine and force every commit to pass whatever checks the team has enabled. If a commit doesn't pass, git will reject it, preventing you from saving your work. Common checks include enforcing code formatting, checking for untracked files, or even running unit tests.</p>
<p>Here's why git pre-commit hooks don't work for me, and what I prefer instead.</p>
<p>First, why is enforcing checks on every commit a bad thing? Because some developers, like me, make lots of draft commits that are never meant to be shared. I use commits as checkpoints. I might be experimenting with something risky and want an easy rollback point, or it might be the end of the day and I want to save my work. None of these commits will be reviewed by others. They only exist for me.</p>
<p>So the last thing I want when I'm trying to save my work is a tool deciding whether I'm allowed to do so. Just let me commit. Yes, I know I can skip the hooks with <code>--no-verify</code>, manually remove them (though they will be automatically reinstalled the next time you run <code>npm install</code>, for example), or set <code>HUSKY=0</code> for Husky, but having to do this every time is annoying. Why create the problem in the first place? I don't want to bypass checks. I want to decide when to run them, when I know my code is ready, not every time I create a checkpoint.</p>
<p>A better alternative is this. Instead of enforcing checks in pre-commit hooks, expose those same checks as explicit commands. For example: <code>make test</code>, <code>make test.types</code>, <code>make test.unit</code>, etc. Developers are then free to run these commands when it makes sense for them, and they can still wire them into pre-commit hooks if they want.</p>
<p>An added bonus is that these same commands can be reused in CI/CD pipelines to enforce checks before merging a pull request.</p>
